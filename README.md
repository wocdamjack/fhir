# development setup

if you are not using the devcontainer from this project with [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension you need to have angular cli and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
yarn install
```

## usage

Run `ng serve` to start the app, app will be at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/).
If you use the Visual Code functionality with Remote containers: Open Folder in container option, you need to start it with `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0`.

if you use localhost and have cross site blocking issues within chrome start chrome directly from command line (osx)

/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --disable-features=CrossSiteDocumentBlockingAlways,CrossSiteDocumentBlockingIfIsolating

## running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## deploying to github pages

ng build --prod --base-href "http://github.ahdis.ch/ng-fhir-sample"
